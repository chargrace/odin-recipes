    <p><h4 class="header">Ingredients</h4></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pumpkin, about 1.5-2kg (save the seeds – toast them in a dry pan to serve)</li>
            <li>1tbsp garam masala</li>
            <li>2tsp ground coriander</li>
            <li>2tsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>1tsp chilli flakes or powder, plus a pinch</li>
            <li>3tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>ginger, peeled and finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
            <li>900ml veg stock</li>
            <li>100ml double cream or crème fraiche, plus extra to serve</li>
        </ul>
        <p><h4 class="header">Steps</h4></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Cut the pumpkin in half and remove the seeds with a spoon (see tip below). Cut into wedges or chunks (keep the skin on) and tip into a bowl. Put the garam masala, and 1 tsp each of the coriander and cumin into a small bowl and mix with 2 tbsp of the oil and season. Drizzle over the pumpkin and toss well to coat in the spiced oil. Transfer to a baking tray, spread out evenly and roast for 40-45 mins, turning halfway through cooking, until the pumpkin is very soft when pierced with a fork. Leave to cool on the tray for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat the remaining 1 tbsp olive oil in a large saucepan and fry the onion with a pinch of salt for 10 mins until soft. Add the ginger, garlic and remaining spices and chilli flakes, and fry for a few more minutes until fragrant. Pour in the stock and bring to a gentle simmer.</li>
            <li>When the pumpkin is cool enough to touch, use a spoon to scoop the soft flesh from the skins. Add the soft pumpkin to the stock pan, discarding the skins. Remove from the heat and blitz the soup with a hand blender until creamy and smooth. Season to taste, adding extra chilli or garam masala if you like. Put back over a low heat and stir in the cream. Bring to a gentle simmer, then serve in bowls with a drizzle more cream and a pinch of chilli to serve. Top with toasted pumpkin seeds, if you like.</li>
        </ol>
